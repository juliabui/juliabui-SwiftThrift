                    <p> Hello! My name is Julia Bui. I am the team's frontend lead. I am currently a fourth year computer
                        science major with a minor in math! I switched from pre-nursing and hope to graduate fall '2025 or 
                        the following semester. <br> <br>
                        
                        I did my first two years of college at a community college in San Diego, where I was born and raised. And 
                        I have been at SFSU for almost two years now!
