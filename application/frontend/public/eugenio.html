                    Hi! My name is Eugenio. I am an international transfer student currently studying Computer Science at SF State. 
                    My role in this project involves programming the backend of our application and serving as the GitHub lead for the team.

                    Most of my programming experience comes from working on private servers for old games like Club Penguin!
