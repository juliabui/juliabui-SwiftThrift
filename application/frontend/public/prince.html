        <p> "Hello! I'm Prince Lucky F. Santos, a Computer Science major at San Francisco State
            University and a senior undergraduate who is graduating this Spring of 2025.
            
            Most of my programming experience revolves around video game development, often involving
            the implementation of the game's mechanics and making various system that work for
            the gameplay as well as for its bug-less-ness. When it comes to outside of this
            specialization, I am able to engineer and develop relatively complex systems to
            effective do certain functions, like managing the data within a hard drive using
            a File Allocation Table or connnecting both the database and the users' input through
            mySQL. 
            
            Other than this, I've also kept this interest in video game development through club 
            activities, of which I am now an officer. If you are a student of SFSU and are also 
            interested in video game development, you should join the Game Development Club. I 
            promise you won't regret it. :]"</p>
