                    <p> Hello! I'm Prince Lucky F. Santos, a Computer Science major at San Francisco State
                        University and a senior undergraduate who is graduating this Spring of 2025.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of my programming experience revolves around video game development, often involving
                        the implementation of the game's mechanics and making various system that work for
                        the gameplay as well as for its bug-less-ness. When it comes to outside of this
                        specialization, I am able to engineer and develop relatively complex systems to
                        effective do certain functions, like managing the data within a hard drive using
                        a File Allocation Table or connnecting both the database and the users' input through
                        mySQL. 
                        <br><br>
                        Other than this, I've also kept this interest in video game development through club 
                        activities, of which I am now an officer. If you are a student of SFSU and are also 
                        interested in video game development, you should join the Game Development Club. I 
                        promise you won't regret it. :]</p>
