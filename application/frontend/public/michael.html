        <p> "Hello my name is Michael! I am in my fourth year at SF State majoring in computer science, I am planning to graduate possibly in this upcoming semester or Spring 2025! 
            In my free time I enjoy things like watching movies/shows, playing video games, and going running! Most of my programming experiences have been the courses I have taken at SF State. 
            A fun fact about me is that I have lived in San Francisco my whole life!"
